## Reporting bugs ##

Software doesn't react the same way for all users. When you experience unexpected behavior, your bug report needs to give me all details necessary to reproduce this issue on my computer. It's simple: **what can't be reproduced, won't be fixed**.

Example:

**WRONG :(**

"Lyrics don't work!" "Covers don't show!" "Dopamine crashes!" "Dopamine is unstable!"

**RIGHT :)**

- Send the log file (The little "bug" icon on the main window, or pressing CTRL+L will help you find it)
